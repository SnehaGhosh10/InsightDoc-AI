"Turn Static PDFs into Dynamic Conversations with AI"

🚀 Overview

InsightDocAI is an AI-powered document Q&A system that enables users to upload PDF files and chat with them naturally, just like interacting with an expert. It utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), FAISS vector search, and Groq-hosted LLMs to extract accurate, context-rich answers from your documents.

Say goodbye to manual document scanning—InsightDocAI helps users instantly extract insights, clarify legal clauses, summarize academic papers, and explore technical reports.

🎯 Problem It Solves

In industries like law, research, finance, and tech, professionals deal with lengthy documents:

Manually searching for information is slow and error-prone.

Key insights often remain buried under pages of irrelevant data.

Traditional search lacks context and semantic understanding.

🔍 InsightDocAI bridges this gap by transforming static documents into interactive, AI-driven conversations, saving hours of manual labor and boosting productivity.

✅ Upload and chat with PDF documents instantly

✅ Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual accuracy

✅ Uses FAISS for lightning-fast semantic search

✅ Built-in Streamlit UI for an intuitive and modern chat experience

✅ Supports real-time question-answering with multi-turn conversation memory

✅ Fast LLM integration via Groq API

🛠️ Tech Stack


💻 Programming-Python

🧠 LLM Backend-Groq API

📚 Vector DB-	FAISS

📄 Parsing-	PyPDF + LangChain

⚙️ How It Works

📤 Upload PDF
➤ The PDF is parsed and split into smaller, meaningful chunks.

🧬 Embeddings Generation
➤ Each chunk is transformed into high-dimensional vector embeddings.

📚 FAISS Semantic Search
➤ Relevant chunks are retrieved based on your natural language query.

🧠 LLM Response Generation
➤ Context + query are passed to the LLM to generate an accurate response.

💬 Interactive Chat Interface
➤ The answer is shown in an intuitive Streamlit-based chat UI.
